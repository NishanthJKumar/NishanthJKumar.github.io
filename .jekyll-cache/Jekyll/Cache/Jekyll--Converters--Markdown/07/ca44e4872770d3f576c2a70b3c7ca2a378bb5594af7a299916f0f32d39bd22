<p>Hi there, and welcome to my personal website! My nameâ€™s Nishanth and Iâ€™m an AI + Robotics Research Scientist and Software Engineer who moonlights as a Writer and Entrepreneur.</p>

<p>Presently, Iâ€™m a Junior at <a href="https://www.brown.edu/">Brown University</a> whoâ€™s <em>officially</em> concentrating in Computer Engineering and researching AI within the Computer Science department, but <em>unofficially</em> does everything from <a href="https://orgsync.com/126728/chapter">novel writing</a> to <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/people/meta-ura/">promoting undergrad research</a> within the CS department. In the past, Iâ€™ve helped develop and run Brownâ€™s <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs2951f/">Graduate-Level Reinforcement Learning course</a>, <a href="https://brownspace.org/rd/">launched high-altitude balloons</a> with Brown Space Engineering and even served as a <a href="https://www.brown.edu/admission/undergraduate/visit/physical-sciences-tour">Science Tour Guide</a>. Outside of CS and Engineering, I run a <a href="https://www.paragon.school/">coaching and college-counseling company</a> for high-school students and sometimes try to make progress on a young-adult sci-fi novel Iâ€™ve been writing for the last 6 years (that will hopefully be done <em>someday</em>â€¦).</p>

<p>I grew up playing street-cricket and learning to love Dosa in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Coimbatore,+Tamil+Nadu,+India/@11.0116773,76.8268011,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x3ba859af2f971cb5:0x2fc1c81e183ed282!8m2!3d11.0168445!4d76.9558321">Coimbatore, India</a>. During my time in India, <a href="http://tipskovai.com/news-events/maths-geek-nishanth-kumar/">I studied and eventually taught the IB</a>, played a ton of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn2AA5p7Q-Y">basketball</a>, wrote and semi self-published <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Book_of_the_Heavens.html?id=U_AKZPObpxsC">a novel</a>, built and competed with <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/coimbatore-students-bag-award-in-robotics-contest/article7258141.ece">robots</a>, interned at a <a href="https://www.forgeforward.in/">startup accelerator</a>, and even built a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvA7EftdSak">popular science fair project</a>.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re interested in reaching out or learning more about me, check out my social links in the website footer. If youâ€™d like me to respond directly, Iâ€™m probably most available by email. I always love meeting new people and discussing, collaborating or advising in any way I can, so donâ€™t hesitate to contact!</p>
