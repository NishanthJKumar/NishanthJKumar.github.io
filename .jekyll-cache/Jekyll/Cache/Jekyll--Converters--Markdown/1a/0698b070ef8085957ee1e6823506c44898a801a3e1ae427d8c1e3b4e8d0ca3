I"<p>Recently, I was incredibly excited and humbled to learn that I was selected as a <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/">2021 NSF GRFP Fellow</a>. Like most of my accomplishments, this one was only made possible by the support of friends and colleagues, and the mentorship of my incredible advisors at Brown. One resource I found particularly helpful for this application was previous successful applications, specifically <a href="https://vdean.github.io/">Victoria Deanâ€™s</a> and <a href="https://blog.nelsonliu.me/2020/10/13/nsf-grfp-materials/">Nelson Liuâ€™s</a>. Given how useful these were for me, I figured Iâ€™d share my own application materials to contribute to the genre and help any future applicants. You can find both my research and personal essays linked below.</p>
