I"t<p>Writing a good PhD SoP can be a daunting task. Fortunately, there are plenty of good posts out there about how to approach the writing process and what a good SoP looks like (in particular, I followed the structure laid out by <a href="https://timdettmers.com/2018/11/26/phd-applications/">this post</a> by <a href="https://timdettmers.com/">Tim Dettmers</a> and <a href="https://h2r.cs.brown.edu/writing-a-research-statement-for-graduate-school-and-fellowships/">this post</a> by my undergrad advisor <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Pd8-ju0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Stefanie Tellex</a>). When I was writing my own SoP, what I probably found most-helpful on top of the above-linked posts was reading SoP’s by students in related areas who had been successful with the PhD application process (in particular <a href="https://blog.nelsonliu.me/2020/11/11/phd-personal-statement/">this one</a> from <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~nfliu/">Nelson Liu</a>). Given how much I benefitted from these, I figured I’d try to give back and contribute to the genre. Below, you can read the SoP that helped me get admitted to MIT:</p>
