I"ó<p>Ever since my parents bought me my first robotic toy as a kid, Iâ€™ve been excited about robots. Over the years, Iâ€™ve been lucky enough to have had numerous opportunities to work with robots. Iâ€™ve played with toys, spent multiple years building Lego and heavy-metal robots for competitions, and most-recently done research with robots. So, when it came time for me to seriously consider what I want to do with the rest of my life, â€˜work with robotsâ€™ was the first and natural choice.</p>
