<p>Hi there, and welcome to my personal website! My nameâ€™s Nishanth and Iâ€™m a researcher and engineer focused on AI and ML applications to robotics. I also moonlight as a writer and entrepreneur.</p>

<p>Presently, Iâ€™m a Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://lis.csail.mit.edu/">LIS Group</a> within <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/">MIT CSAIL</a>. Iâ€™m officially advised by <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/leslie-kaelbling">Leslie Kaelbling</a> and <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/tlp/">TomÃ¡s Lozano-PÃ©rez</a>, though I frequently collaborate with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4mVPFQ8AAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Dylan Hadfield-Menell</a> and many other wonderful people within CSAILâ€™s <a href="https://ei.csail.mit.edu/">Embodied Intelligence Initiative</a>. Iâ€™m extremely grateful for support from the <a href="https://engineering.brown.edu/news/2021-03-29/nsf-graduate-research-award">NSF Graduate Research Fellowship</a>.</p>

<p>In the recent past, I graduated from <a href="https://www.brown.edu/">Brown University</a> with honors in Computer Engineering. As an undergrad, I was fortunate to work on exciting <a href="https://nishanthjkumar.com/research/">AI + Robotics research</a> under Brownâ€™s <a href="http://bigai.cs.brown.edu/">BigAI initiative</a> advised by Professors <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/people/stellex/">Stefanie Tellex</a>, <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/people/gdk/">George Konidaris</a> and <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~mlittman/">Michael Littman</a>. Iâ€™ve also been a Research Intern at <a href="https://www.uber.com/ca/en/atg/research-and-development/">Uber ATG</a> under <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~urtasun/">Prof. Raquel Urtasun</a> and at <a href="https://www.vicarious.com/">Vicarious AI</a>, and collaborated with researchers at <a href="https://www.merl.com/research/">MERL</a>.</p>

<p>Outside of all this, I help run a <a href="https://www.paragon.school/">coaching and college-counseling company</a> for high-school students and sometimes make progress on a young-adult sci-fi novel and some short stories that Iâ€™ve been writing for longer than I care to admit.</p>
