I"E<p>This year’s <a href="https://www.corl2023.org/">CoRL</a> was the biggest CoRL yet, with over 900 attendees, 11 workshops, and almost 200 accepted papers. While there were <em>a lot</em> of cool new ideas (see <a href="https://seungchan-kim.github.io/notes/CoRL_2023_Note.pdf">this great set of notes</a> for an overview of technical content), one particular debate seemed to be front-and-center: “is training a large neural network on a very large dataset a feasible way to solve robotics?”<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
