<p style="text-align: center;font-size: 120%">Welcome to my Research page!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;font-size: 120%">I’m currently an Undergraduate Research Assistant in the <a href="https://h2r.cs.brown.edu/">Humans 2 Robots</a> and <a href="http://irl.cs.brown.edu/">Intelligent Robot</a> Labs at Brown University. I work within Brown’s <a href="http://bigai.cs.brown.edu/">BigAI initiative</a> and am advised by Professors <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/people/stellex/">Stefanie Tellex</a>, <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/people/gdk/">George Konidaris</a> and <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~mlittman/">Michael Littman</a>.</p>

<h2 id="research-interests">Research Interests</h2>
<p>I’m broadly interested in the fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Robotics. More specifically, I’m drawn to the sub-fields of Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning, Classical AI Planning, Representation and Heuristics for Planning and Mixed Reality for Robotics. I’m particularly interested in working towards intelligent, collaborative robots; which lies at the intersection of all my different interests.</p>

<p>My current work involves thinking about good representations for AI agents and enabling efficient planning within them. Specifically, I’m focusing on object-oriented representations and how their inherent structure can be used to speed-up decision making under uncertainty. I believe that creating representations that are both highly-structured while also being intuitive to humans will enable more sample-efficient and explainable AI.</p>

<p>Other current things I’m interested in / working on include Learning from Demonstrations (LfD) and Transfer Learning, and using Mixed Reality to enable robots to effectively collaborate with and acquire multi-modal knowledge from humans.</p>
