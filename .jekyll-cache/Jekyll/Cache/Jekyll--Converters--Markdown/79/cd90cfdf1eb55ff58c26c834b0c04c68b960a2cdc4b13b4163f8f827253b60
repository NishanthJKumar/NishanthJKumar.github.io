I"¨<p>Iâ€™ve been asked this a bunch of times and here it finally is: the essay I wrote for the CommonApp. I think itâ€™s really representative of the headspace I was in at the time (and admittedly still am in, to some degree). If youâ€™re reading this and struggling with college essay, then let me say that Iâ€™ve been there too and Iâ€™ve got advice: just write the most honest reflection of yourself. Thatâ€™s it. And thatâ€™s what I attempted to do below.</p>

<p>In case youâ€™re wondering, I was accepted into Brown with this essay, but rejected pretty much everywhere else; though I donâ€™t think you should read too much into that.</p>

<p>Here it is!</p>

<p>â€œPatience is a virtueâ€. This was the answer I got to most questions I asked as a child.
Be it â€œWhat research should I do to win a Nobel Prize?â€, or even â€œHow do I go about making a Batman grapple
gun?â€, I was always told to be patient.â€™</p>

<p>â€œYouâ€™re not old enough to do that yetâ€, they would reply, â€œYou need to wait to grow upâ€.</p>

<p>But I hated waiting, especially for unknown, indeterminate amounts of time. But since everyone I asked told me
the same thing, I figured it must be true. So, I would force myself to wait and put all my ambitious ideas on hold
while I attempted to learn this supposed â€œvirtueâ€ of patience.</p>

<p>One effective way I found of passing my time was through reading. My love for reading soon kindled another
desire: to write something.</p>

<p>Like every other desire or idea Iâ€™d ever had, this seemed great and perfectly plausible.
My mind immediately began dreaming up characters, plot, page counts, chapter names and even possible
publishers. I enthusiastically approached my fifth grade English teacher with my plans, confident that she too
would see the brilliance of my ideas and guide me forward.</p>

<p>â€œItâ€™s great that you want to write.â€, she said, â€œbut good writing takes time. You have much more to learn. Remember, patience is a virtueâ€. Once again, my ideas were met with the exact same response: â€œpatience is a
virtueâ€. But I didnâ€™t understand patience, and I didnâ€™t understand why I had to wait. So this time, instead of
abandoning my idea and resigning to patience, I decided to try. I was convinced I could do it, though there was still
the overwhelming feeling that everyone else was right.</p>

<p>So I began writing. Surprisingly, it wasnâ€™t as easy as Iâ€™d thought. There were so many times when I hit a dead end
and almost gave up. But I kept going, just to see if I could finish it. One year and 35,000 words later, I had a
completed manuscript.</p>

<p>But I wasnâ€™t content: I wanted to get it published.</p>

<p>â€œItâ€™s great that youâ€™ve written something, but you should probably wait till you older before you publishâ€, my friends
said. Theyâ€™d never heard of a published author as young as I was. I hadnâ€™t either, and like them, I was fairly certain
that I had to be patient and write something else to get published. But still, since I had come this far, I wanted to
try. So I sent my manuscript to a few online publishers.</p>

<p>A few weeks later, I got a reply from a publisher interested in publishing my book.</p>

<p>Three years later, that first book was officially published; the very same book that people told me would never get
published because I was too young.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, my book did not become the record-breaking, Pulitzer-winning, multi-million bestseller that I had
hoped (JK Rowling made things look way too easy). Still, the fact that it was published represented something
huge for me: I didnâ€™t have to be patient. I learnt that there is no such thing as â€œtoo youngâ€.</p>

<p>Even though looking back, that first book seems rather silly and juvenile, I would do it again given the opportunity.
The realization that I could challenge the â€œvirtueâ€ of patience helped me so much. Later on, it helped me lead my
robotics team to win Nationals and represent India despite the fact that other people told us we were â€œtoo youngâ€.</p>

<p>Challenging patience has led me to a new mantra: â€œImpatience is a virtueâ€. While patience is always important,
itâ€™s the stubborn desire to be impatient, work hard and not wait for others that drives great accomplishments. Yes,
impatience might not always succeed, but Iâ€™d rather try and fail than wait around to grow older or gain other
peopleâ€™s approval.</p>

<p>After all, no one ever changed the world by waiting around.</p>
