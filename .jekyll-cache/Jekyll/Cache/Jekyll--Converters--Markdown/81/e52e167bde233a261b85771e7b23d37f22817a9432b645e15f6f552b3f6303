  <li>you’d like to collaborate on a research project.</li>

  <li>you’re a student looking for advice/help that you think I’m well-equipped to provide. I love helping people with similar interests/backgrounds in any way I can — I benefitted significantly from advice from more senior students and mentors, and paying this forward is very important to me.</li>
