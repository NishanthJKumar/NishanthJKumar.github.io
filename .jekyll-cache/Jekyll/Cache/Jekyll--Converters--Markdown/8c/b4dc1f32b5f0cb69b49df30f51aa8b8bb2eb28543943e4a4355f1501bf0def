<p>Hi there, and welcome to my personal website! My name‚Äôs Nishanth and I‚Äôm a researcher and engineer focused on AI and ML applied to robotics. I also moonlight as a writer.</p>

<p>Presently, I‚Äôm a Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://lis.csail.mit.edu/">LIS Group</a> within <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/">MIT CSAIL</a>. I‚Äôm officially advised by <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/leslie-kaelbling">Leslie Kaelbling</a> and <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/tlp/">Tom√°s Lozano-P√©rez</a> and work within the greater <a href="https://ei.csail.mit.edu/">Embodied Intelligence</a> community of research at CSAIL. I‚Äôm extremely grateful for support from the <a href="https://engineering.brown.edu/news/2021-03-29/nsf-graduate-research-award">NSF Graduate Research Fellowship</a>.</p>

<p>In the recent past, I graduated from <a href="https://www.brown.edu/">Brown University</a> with honors in Computer Engineering. As an undergrad, I was fortunate to work on exciting <a href="https://nishanthjkumar.com/research/">AI + Robotics research</a> under Brown‚Äôs <a href="http://bigai.cs.brown.edu/">BigAI initiative</a> advised by Professors <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/people/stellex/">Stefanie Tellex</a>, <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/people/gdk/">George Konidaris</a> and <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~mlittman/">Michael Littman</a>. I spent time as a Research Intern at <a href="https://www.uber.com/ca/en/atg/research-and-development/">Uber ATG</a> and <a href="https://www.vicarious.com/">Vicarious AI</a>, and even had the opportunity to collaborate with researchers at <a href="https://www.merl.com/research/">MERL</a>.</p>

<p>Outside of all this, I like to lift heavy things, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36308161-nishanth-kumar">read</a>, play basketball, philosophize, cook, and sometimes make progress on various sci-fi novels/short-stories that I‚Äôve been writing for longer than I care to admit.</p>
