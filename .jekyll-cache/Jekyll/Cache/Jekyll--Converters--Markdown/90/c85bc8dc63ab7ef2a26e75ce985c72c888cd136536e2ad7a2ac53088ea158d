I"Œ<p>Over winter break, I had the opportunity to write an extended abstract (my first first-author thing!) for an idea Iâ€™d been kicking around with some other members of my lab. We ended up submitting said abstract to VAM-HRI 2019: a workshop centered on Mixed-Reality for Human-Robot Interaction. Fortunately enough, our work got accepted (find it here!) and I had the incredible opportunity to miss a week of classes to attend Human-Robot Interaction 2019 in South Korea! This was my first ever robotics conference and what follows will be my thoughts from the conference, roughly organized as below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Major takeaways + trends from HRI 2019</li>
  <li>Robot companies + demos!</li>
  <li>Overall thoughts</li>
  <li>Travelling in Korea + Misc.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="major-takeaways-and-trends-from-hri-2019">Major Takeaways and Trends from HRI 2019</h1>
<h2 id="1-the-rise-of-virtual-augmented-and-mixed-reality">1. The rise of Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Reality</h2>
<p>I admit that this may be my own biased opinion. After all, my primary purpose behind going to this conference was to attend the VAM (Virtual, Augmented and Mixed-Reality) workshop where I myself had authored work that heavily relied on Mixed Reality. But, I was (pleasantly) surprised to see quite a few people that werenâ€™t just part of VAM-HRI actually use VR, AR or MR for things from robot learning to conducting experiments on social robots.</p>
