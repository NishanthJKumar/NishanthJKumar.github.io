I"Ï<p>Some weeks ago, I had the pleasure of attending the 36th International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) in Montreal, Canada. This was my first major Robotics and AI focused conference and it was probably one of the most interesting and learning-intensive weeks Iâ€™ve ever had. This post is an overview of my conference experience, most-interesting things I learnt, most-exciting research directions I saw and cool robots that were on display!</p>
