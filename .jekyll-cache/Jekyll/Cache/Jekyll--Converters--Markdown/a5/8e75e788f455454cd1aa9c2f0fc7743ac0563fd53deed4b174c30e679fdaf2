<p>Hi there, and welcome to my personal website! My name’s Nishanth and I’m a researcher and engineer focused on AI and ML applications to robotics. I also moonlight as a writer and entrepreneur.</p>

<p>Presently, I’m a Senior at <a href="https://www.brown.edu/">Brown University</a> concentrating in Computer Engineering and <a href="https://nishanthjkumar.com/research/">researching AI + Robotics</a> under Brown’s <a href="http://bigai.cs.brown.edu/">BigAI initiative</a> I’m advised by Professors <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/people/stellex/">Stefanie Tellex</a>, <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/people/gdk/">George Konidaris</a> and <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~mlittman/">Michael Littman</a>. In the past, I’ve been a Research Intern at <a href="https://www.uber.com/ca/en/atg/research-and-development/">Uber ATG</a> under <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~urtasun/">Prof. Raquel Urtasun</a>, collaborated with researchers at <a href="https://www.merl.com/research/">MERL</a>, helped develop and run Brown’s <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs2951f/">Graduate-Level Reinforcement Learning course</a>, <a href="https://brownspace.org/rd/">launched high-altitude balloons</a> with Brown Space Engineering, and even served as a <a href="https://www.brown.edu/admission/undergraduate/visit/physical-sciences-tour">Brown Science Tour Guide</a>. Outside of CS and Engineering, I run a <a href="https://www.paragon.school/">coaching and college-counseling company</a> for high-school students and sometimes make progress on a young-adult sci-fi novel I’ve been writing for longer than I care to admit.</p>

<p>I grew up playing street-cricket and learning to love Dosa in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Coimbatore,+Tamil+Nadu,+India/@11.0116773,76.8268011,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x3ba859af2f971cb5:0x2fc1c81e183ed282!8m2!3d11.0168445!4d76.9558321">Coimbatore, India</a>. During my time in India, <a href="http://tipskovai.com/news-events/maths-geek-nishanth-kumar/">I studied and eventually taught the IB</a>, wrote and semi self-published <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Book_of_the_Heavens.html?id=U_AKZPObpxsC">a novel</a>, built and competed with <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/coimbatore-students-bag-award-in-robotics-contest/article7258141.ece">robots</a>, and even built a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvA7EftdSak">popular science fair project</a>.</p>
