I"Î<p>Iâ€™ve been asked this a bunch of times and here it finally is: the essay I wrote for the CommonApp. I think itâ€™s really representative of the headspace I was in at the time (and admittedly still am in, to some degree). If youâ€™re reading this and struggling with college essay, then let me say that Iâ€™ve been there too and Iâ€™ve got advice: just write the most honest reflection of yourself. Thatâ€™s it. And thatâ€™s what I attempted to do below.</p>
