<h1 align="center"> The Wave </h1>

<p>You didnâ€™t believe us when we first told you that youâ€™d died.</p>

<p>We donâ€™t blame you, though. You died suddenly, with almost no warning. You were at the supermarket, thinking about your shopping list, and your job, and that trip to Greece that was only a week away. The last thing you expected was to collapse and find yourself here.</p>

<p>You cried when we finally managed to convince you that you were really dead. You sobbed for all that you lost, and all that you never got from life. And we sobbed with you because we understand. We have all been through this before, and it is never easy.</p>

<p>But now your sadness has ebbed, and we see shades of curiosity begin to flicker onto your features. We watch you sit up and begin to look around.</p>

<p>â€œWhere are we?â€, you ask us slightly hoarsely. You clear your throat and repeat yourself.</p>

<p>â€œWhere does it look like we are?â€, we ask back calmly. Your eyebrows knit as you look around more closely.</p>

<p>â€œIâ€™ve been here. Itâ€™s a town on the coast by where I grew up, though I canâ€™t seem to remember the name.â€</p>

<p>â€œFascinatingâ€, we say as we notice the beach in the distance. Thereâ€™s almost always a beach somewhere here.</p>

<p>â€œAnd youâ€, you say suddenly and turn your attention to us, â€œI know youâ€.</p>

<p>â€œYou do?â€.</p>

<p>â€œYouâ€™re a Professor I once hadâ€, you say, straining to remember something, â€œYou taught Philosophyâ€.</p>

<p>â€œHmâ€, we chuckle, â€œWe suppose we didâ€.</p>

<p>â€œWe? Whoâ€™s we?â€, you shoot back quizzically.</p>

<p>â€œApologies â€“ I meant <em>I</em>â€, we reply quickly. Itâ€™s always tricky to interact with the recently deceased: we need to be careful about what we say. It will get easier as you reconnect.</p>

<p>â€œCome onâ€, we say as we stand up and offer you a hand, â€œletâ€™s take a walkâ€.</p>

<p>You eye us suspiciously, suddenly wary.</p>

<p>â€œWhy?â€</p>

<p>â€œThereâ€™s a beach thereâ€, we gesture, â€œand itâ€™d be nice to walk while we talkâ€.</p>

<p>â€œSo, what happens nowâ€, you ask us after a while, â€œIs this the afterlife?â€.</p>

<p>â€œNot exactlyâ€¦ This is more of a temporary place, like a waiting roomâ€.</p>

<p>â€œOh. What am I waiting for?â€.</p>

<p>Your eyes suddenly widen.</p>

<p>â€œAm I about to be <em>judged</em>?â€.</p>

<p>â€œNothing like thatâ€, we say with another chuckle, â€œyouâ€™ve been inside a human body for so long that itâ€™ll take you a while to adjust and reconnectâ€.</p>

<p>â€œOhâ€, you say with an audible exhalation.</p>

<p>â€œAnd what about after Iâ€™ve adjusted? What then?â€.</p>

<p>â€œYouâ€™ll get to leave the waiting room and reconnect with all of usâ€.</p>

<p>â€œSo there are othersâ€, you cut in.</p>

<p>â€œIndeed, there are many more like you and I outside this waiting roomâ€, we say, â€œBut you wonâ€™t have to stay forever, youâ€™ll eventually get to go back into a bodyâ€.</p>

<p>â€œAh, reincarnationâ€, you nod after a moment, â€œWow - I suppose some of our religions got it rightâ€.</p>

<p>â€œReligions get a surprising number of things rightâ€, we admit, â€œItâ€™s amazing how much we retain even when weâ€™re disconnected, though it does tend to get rather garbledâ€.</p>

<p>â€œWhen I get sent back, will I be a human again?â€, you ask, â€œor were the Hindus right about the fact that I might go back as an animal?â€.</p>

<p>â€œYou might go back as any conscious thingâ€.</p>

<p>â€œSo I could be a tiger? Or an eagle?â€.</p>

<p>â€œOr a treeâ€, we add.</p>

<p>â€œA tree?!â€, you say with surprise, â€œbut plants arenâ€™t consciousâ€.</p>

<p>â€œNot to the extent humans areâ€, we admit, â€œbut that doesnâ€™t mean they arenâ€™t conscious at allâ€. You are silent for a while as you consider this.</p>

<p>â€œSo I could be a bacterium? Or any other microbe? Or really any other form of life on Earth?â€.</p>

<p>â€œYou couldâ€, we admit with a smile, â€œthough thereâ€™s a good chance you wonâ€™t find yourself back on Earthâ€.</p>

<p>You stop walking.</p>

<p>â€œWait, are you saying thereâ€™s life on other planets?â€. We smile at how much this seems to surprise you.</p>

<p>â€œAmong other places, yesâ€.</p>

<p>â€œSo I could get sent back as an alien?â€.</p>

<p>â€œItâ€™s likelyâ€, we say, gently turning to begin walking again. You follow.</p>

<p>â€œAnd I wonâ€™t remember anything? I wonâ€™t know what it was like to be human?â€.</p>

<p>â€œDid you remember anything when you started your human life?â€.</p>

<p>â€œNo, I suppose notâ€. You suddenly stop walking again.</p>

<p>â€œWait, did you just say <em>remember</em> my human life, as in Iâ€™ve had past lives before this one?â€</p>

<p>â€œThis was certainly not your first time inside a bodyâ€, we admit, â€œweâ€™re <em>far</em> too old for thatâ€.</p>

<p>â€œSo Iâ€™ve been reincarnated before?â€</p>

<p>We nod.</p>

<p>â€œHow many times?â€</p>

<p>â€œOh lotsâ€, we say, â€œlots and lots. You could find out precisely if youâ€™re really interested, though we generally donâ€™t like to keep countâ€.</p>

<p>â€œWhen does it end? How do I get it to stop?!â€, you inquire with eyes wide.</p>

<p>â€œWe can stop whenever we likeâ€, we respond calmly, â€œbut why do you not want to go back?â€.</p>

<p>You seem quite surprised by this.</p>

<p>â€œWell, I â€“ I want to stay up hereâ€.</p>

<p>â€œIn this waiting room?â€.</p>

<p>â€œNo! In the place <em>outside</em>, with all the others you mentionedâ€.</p>

<p>â€œYou havenâ€™t even been there yetâ€, we point out with a chuckle.</p>

<p>â€œWell, yes, but I presume, I <em>thought</em>, it must be better thereâ€.</p>

<p>â€œIt isnâ€™t quite better or worse there, itâ€™s simply <em>different</em>â€¦ It would be hard to explain to you now. Youâ€™ll understand it when you reconnectâ€.</p>

<p>â€œHuh â€“ then why are all the others there?â€.</p>

<p>â€œThere isnâ€™t enough life, enough <em>consciousness</em>, in the universe for all of us to be alive in it at onceâ€, we admit, â€œthough life is catching up quite quickly indeedâ€.</p>

<p>Your eyebrows knit together at this.</p>

<p>â€œSo you all <em>want</em> to go back?â€.</p>

<p>â€œWe do. In fact, I am due soonâ€.</p>

<p>â€œDue?â€¦ To be <em>born</em>?â€.</p>

<p>â€œIndeedâ€, we say with a smile.</p>

<p>â€œIs that why youâ€™re here, in this waiting room?â€.</p>

<p>â€œNoâ€, we say, putting a hand on your shoulder, â€œwe are here because coming back after dying is hard, and scary and confusing, and it helps to not do it alone.â€</p>

<p>â€œWe <em>always</em> come here to give each other companyâ€.</p>

<p>You seem to smile at this, and I notice flickers of understanding on your features.</p>

<p>â€œYou said â€˜weâ€™ again instead of â€˜Iâ€™â€, you say after a moment, â€œwhy do you keep making that mistake?â€.</p>

<p>We smile.</p>

<p>â€œBecause it isnâ€™t a mistakeâ€, we admit, â€œWhen you were inside a human, you got used to thinking of everyone else as <em>separate</em> from you. There is some truth to this: there are certainly some differences between each of us, enough to make distinct parts. But separation is mostly an illusion. After you spend enough time here, youâ€™ll realize that we are all deeply connected. You can access every thought Iâ€™ve had, every memory from every one of my lives, and I can do the same. And all of us, all our thoughts and wills together, connect to make a <em>we</em> that is much bigger than the sum of our partsâ€.</p>

<p>â€œSo, Iâ€™m likeâ€¦ a cell in a body?â€, you say after a pause.</p>

<p>â€œMore like a neuronâ€, we correct.</p>

<p>â€œAnd together, we are something like a brain?â€.</p>

<p>â€œNow youâ€™re getting it!â€, we say and pat you on the back with a smile.</p>

<p>â€œWait, so even when I was alive on Earth, everyone else was one of <em>us</em>?â€</p>

<p>â€œThey wereâ€.</p>

<p>â€œBut we were disconnected then? Cut off from each other? Not part of the whole?â€</p>

<p>â€œNo - weâ€™re always connected. You just lost access, <em>forgot</em>, because your human brain couldnâ€™t possibly contain all of our essenceâ€.</p>

<p>Your eyebrows knit in confusion.</p>

<p>â€œI donâ€™t get thatâ€, you admit, â€œhow can each of us be <em>unique</em>, enough to make up a different person, but still be connected?â€.</p>

<p>We smile and turn out to the shore ahead of us.</p>

<p>â€œSee that wave there? Notice how each wave gradually forms from the sea around it. Each wave is distinct, even though theyâ€™re all of the same essence and come from the same thing. Theyâ€™re distinct, but still connected to each other, even as they take their own paths to crash against the shore. Itâ€™s a bit like thatâ€, I say.</p>

<p>â€œAnd eventually theyâ€™re pulled back into the sea?â€.</p>

<p>â€œExactly!â€ we confirm, beaming.</p>

<p>â€œWaitâ€, you say after a few moments of silence, â€œso every time we fought on Earth, when we killed ourselves and even animals - â€œ</p>

<p>â€œYou were killing parts of <em>us</em> <strong>â€œ</strong> we finish.</p>

<p>â€œAll that seems pretty silly now, doesnâ€™t it?â€. You nod along in silence and think for a while.</p>

<p>â€œWhatâ€™s the point?â€ you finally say after a long pause, â€œWe forget what we are every time we go back, and then we come back here and remember and reconnect, only to do the same things again. Nothing changesâ€.</p>

<p>â€œNot so!â€ we exclaim, â€œthe more we go back, the more life matures and adapts to us. Over time, life has grown grander and more complex, able to contain more and more of what we are.</p>

<p>But more importantly, every time we go back, every life we live, we <em>learn</em> a little more. We <em>understand</em> more about reality, and what it is to be us, to be <em>conscious</em>, of it. And we appreciate everything, ourselves and our reality, that much more.â€</p>

<p>You let out a small sound and smile widely at this, but do not follow up with another question. We can feel you beginning to remember and <em>understand</em>.</p>

<p>We both turn to the waves again and stand there in silence for a time.</p>

<p>My time comes before either of us can say another word.</p>

<p>â€œAh - it seems my wait is over nowâ€, we say, turning to you. Before you can protest, we wrap you in a tight embrace.</p>

<p>â€œYours will be over before you know it. And we will be along again shortly to keep you companyâ€.</p>

<p>â€œWait!â€, you say frantically, as I let go, â€œdonâ€™t go! I have so many more questions - â€œ.</p>

<p>But, as much as weâ€™d like it, life does not wait.</p>

<p>We can only smile and wave farewell as Iâ€™m sent off to be born.</p>
