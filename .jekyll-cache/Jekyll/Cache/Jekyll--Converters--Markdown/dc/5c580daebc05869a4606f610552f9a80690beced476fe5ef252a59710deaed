I"W<p>Ever since my parents bought me my first robotic toy as a kid, I’ve been excited about robots. Over the years, I’ve been lucky enough to have had numerous opportunities to work with robots. I’ve played with toys, spent multiple years building Lego and heavy-metal robots for competitions, and most-recently done research with robots. So, when it came time for me to seriously consider what I want to do with the rest of my life, ‘work with robots’ was the first and natural choice.</p>

<p>A while ago, a friend asked me a simple question: ‘why robots?’. I was quite surprised that this was a question at all: there are so many obvious answers. The more relevant question should’ve been ‘why not robots?’. When my friend pointed out that that wasn’t a sufficient answer, I realized I hadn’t really thought through all my reasons for wanting to work with robots. I’m a big believer in carefully and consciously reasoning from first principles when it comes to major life decisions, so it was quite alarming that I didn’t have a satisfactory answer to the simple question of ‘why robots?’.</p>

<p>I spent a long while thinking about my answer to this fundamental question and fortunately came up with one that I find quite satisfactory. This essay is an attempt to capture and record that answer.</p>

<p>So, why robots you ask?</p>

<h2 id="the-greatest-tool-ever-invented">The Greatest Tool Ever Invented</h2>
<p>A couple millennia ago, Homo Sapiens’ lives were quite difficult indeed. The primary concern was food: most Sapiens got hungry at least once every day, and the only solution was to find and consume food. Unfortunately, food didn’t just show up at a centralized location, it usually needed to be hunted. Sapiens needed to chase and kill animals that – to our ancestors’ great annoyance – didn’t want to be killed and eaten. To make existence more annoying, some animals wanted to chase and kill the Sapiens. This presented a difficult existential dilemma: the Sapiens needed to get food without becoming food themselves. This was quite a problem indeed because many of the animals were bigger, stronger and deadlier than the Sapiens.</p>

<p>However, the Sapiens made an important discovery. They realized that these ubiquitous things we call rocks were quite hard. This was a useful property, because the rocks could be used to inflict injuries. However, it was difficult to completely kill an animal with the rocks. At some point, a couple Sapiens realized they could sharpen rocks. They fashioned the first crude axes and spears. Suddenly, hunting and protecting themselves became much easier. Suddenly, they moved to the top of the food chain.</p>

<p>Our ancestors’ discovery and use of rocks might seem trivial or irrelevant, but it is arguably one of the most significant events in human history. Those rocks were our first tools. The discovery and use of tools is considered a unique sign of intelligence. In fact, it is this ability to create tools that’s enabled modern life. From crude spears and axes, we moved on to fire, then clothing, then bricks for construction, then metalworking, then the wheel, then eventually the printing press and later the steam engine, then the electric motor and generator, then the telephone and the electric light bulb, then the transistor which paved the way for the computer and more recently, the Internet. The entire field of technology, the reason that our species expanded from a few scattered tribes to occupy every continent with 8 billion total individuals, is essentially an exercise in understanding the laws of the natural world and using these laws to build tools that will help us exploit it.</p>

<p>And intelligent robots might just be the greatest tool we’ve ever invented.</p>

<p>Like previous world-changing tools, robots have an unprecedented potential to enable. Human bodies have significant limitations: we cannot survive radiation or extreme temperatures and are quite easily injured. With robots, we could spend years constructing extraterrestrial habitats before the first humans would arrive to settle them, we could operate nuclear power stations with an unprecedented level of safety, and we could enable the physically-disabled to do almost any task a normal person could do. Humans are prone to making avoidable mistakes. Robots are much less prone to failure in previously-seen environments, and they could enable us to save lives in medical diagnosis and routine surgery. Humans can’t thrive with a prolonged lack of food, water or sleep and do not enjoy performing repetitive drudgery. Robots could perform drudgery round-the-clock with minimal power and thus enable us to produce and distribute enough resources for every human on Earth to survive and thrive.</p>

<p>Intelligent robots have a seemingly endless number of applications. However, the most transformative applications might be those that are impossible to fathom today. When pioneers like Charles Babbage, Alan Turing and John von Neumann first conceived of computers, they did it for what would seem like an incredibly niche use. They were mostly interested in using computers to quickly solve polynomial equations or compute unwieldy integrals. They probably realized their discoveries would have other uses, but none of them probably ever conceived of digital file storage, video projection, email or the myriad of other things computers have enabled. Similarly, widespread intelligent robots could spawn a myriad of other exciting tools downstream that it’d be impossible to anticipate today.</p>

<p>Robots might just be the next big world-changing tool; the tool that our descendants will look back and wonder how humans lived without. And that prospect excites me to no end.</p>
