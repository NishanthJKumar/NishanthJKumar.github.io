I"¯<p>So this post is actually an article I wrote for my schoolâ€™s student newsletter. I was asked to submit this some time before my TA internship at my school ended and I think it really encompasses my experience and views toward the IB. Iâ€™ve put it here in the hopes that it might be useful to student coming into the IB or trying to decide on their IB school. I hope you guys have as fulfilling an experience as I did ðŸ™‚</p>
