I"Ž<p>One of my favorite blogs in the whole wide Internet is the <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/">MIT Admissions Blog</a>. Admittedly, this used to be because I wanted nothing more than to become an MIT undergrad. However, Iâ€™ve continued to keep up with these blogs even after being rejected from MIT because many of the posts have been exceptionally genuine, relatable, and even insightful. In fact, I actually kept a copy of <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/50_things/">one of my favorite advice posts</a> pinned to my phoneâ€™s notes app throughout my time in college and it stayed relevant and insightful over all 4 years.</p>
