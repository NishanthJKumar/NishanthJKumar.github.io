<p>Hi there, and welcome to my personal website! My name’s Nishanth and I’m a researcher and engineer focused on AI and ML applications to robotics. I also moonlight as a writer and entrepreneur.</p>

<p>Presently, I’m a Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://lis.csail.mit.edu/">LIS Group</a> within <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/">MIT CSAIL</a>. I’m officially advised by <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/leslie-kaelbling">Leslie Kaelbling</a> and <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/tlp/">Tomás Lozano-Pérez</a>, though I frequently collaborate with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4mVPFQ8AAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Dylan Hadfield-Menell</a> and many other wonderful people within CSAIL’s <a href="https://ei.csail.mit.edu/">Embodied Intelligence Initiative</a>. I also spend time at the <a href="https://theaiinstitute.com/">Boston Dynamics AI Institute</a> where I primarily work with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifer-barry-742a0799/">Jennifer Barry</a>. I’m extremely grateful for support from the <a href="https://engineering.brown.edu/news/2021-03-29/nsf-graduate-research-award">NSF Graduate Research Fellowship</a>.</p>

<p>In the recent past, I graduated from <a href="https://www.brown.edu/">Brown University</a> with honors in Computer Engineering. As an undergrad, I was fortunate to work on exciting <a href="https://nishanthjkumar.com/research/">AI + Robotics research</a> under Brown’s <a href="http://bigai.cs.brown.edu/">BigAI initiative</a> advised by Professors <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/people/stellex/">Stefanie Tellex</a>, <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/people/gdk/">George Konidaris</a> and <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~mlittman/">Michael Littman</a>. I spent time as a Research Intern at <a href="https://www.uber.com/ca/en/atg/research-and-development/">Uber ATG</a> and <a href="https://www.vicarious.com/">Vicarious AI</a>, and even had the opportunity to collaborate with researchers at <a href="https://www.merl.com/research/">MERL</a>.</p>

<p>Outside of all this, I like to play basketball, philosophize, cook, and sometimes make progress on various sci-fi novels/short-stories that I’ve been writing for longer than I care to admit.</p>
