New paper on [inventing symbolic predicates using VLM's](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00296) accepted at the [LLM4Plan](https://llmforplanning.github.io/) and [GenPlan](https://aair-lab.github.io/genplan25/) AAAI 2025 workshops! Very excited about continuing to push in this direction and get this stuff onto real-world robots.
