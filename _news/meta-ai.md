I'm excited to spend Summer 2025 as an intern at [FAIR](https://ai.meta.com/research/) in NYC working on improving long-horizon generation and decision-making for LLMs with [Mary Williamson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mary-williamson-9a50337/), [Jimmy Yang](https://sites.google.com/view/tyjimmyyang), and [Yuandong Tian](https://yuandong-tian.com/).
