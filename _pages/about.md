My overarching research goal is to create **general-purpose** AI systems that are capable of solving **useful** sequential decision-making tasks for humans across a wide variety of real-world environments. I'd like to enable **digital AI agents** and **real-world robots** to satisfy complex commands like "book me a cheap trip to a tropical destination I'd like that matches my vacation schedule" or "go buy the necessary ingredients and then make me a cup of my favorite tea". Towards this, I'm interested in combining ideas from **automated planning and search** and **learning** to enable effective scaling at both test and training time respectively. My research draws on ideas from task and motion planning (TAMP), foundation models, reinforcement learning, deep learning, and program synthesis.

I'm currently a 4th Year Ph.D. student with the [LIS Group](https://lis.csail.mit.edu/) within [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/). I'm officially advised by [Leslie Kaelbling](https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/leslie-kaelbling) and [Tomás Lozano-Pérez](https://people.csail.mit.edu/tlp/), and have the pleasure of collaborating with many other wonderful people within CSAIL's [Embodied Intelligence Initiative](https://ei.csail.mit.edu/). I'm extremely grateful for support from the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://engineering.brown.edu/news/2021-03-29/nsf-graduate-research-award). I've also had the pleasure of interning at [NVIDIA Research](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/srl/), the [Robotics and AI Institute](https://rai-inst.com/), [Vicarious AI](https://www.vicarious.com/), and [Uber ATG](https://www.uber.com/us/en/autonomous/?id=14490). Previously, I received an [S.M. degree](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/156279) from [MIT](https://web.mit.edu/), an [Sc.B. with honors](/assets/pdf/Nishanth_Undergrad_Honors_Thesis.pdf) from [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/), and completed the [IB Diploma](https://www.ibo.org/programmes/diploma-programme/) in my hometown of [Coimbatore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coimbatore), India.

Outside of research, I like to lift heavy things, [read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36308161-nishanth-kumar), play basketball, philosophize, cook, and write both fiction and non-fiction.
