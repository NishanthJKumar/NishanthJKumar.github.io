# Contact Me

Thanks for your interest in getting in touch with me! I generally love hearing from people who've come across this website, read below for the best way to reach out.

Email me at **njk[at]mit.edu** or **njk[at]csail.mit.edu** if:
- you have questions/comments/concerns about my research or academic work.
- you'd like to collaborate on a research project.
- you'd like to recruit me for some technical opportunity you think I'd be a good fit for.
- you're a student looking for advice/help that you think I'm well-equipped to provide. I love helping people with similar interests/backgrounds in any way I can --- I benefitted significantly from advice and mentorship, and paying this forward is very important to me.

Email me at **nishanth.kumar20[at]gmail.com** if:
- you have questions or comments about any of my fiction writing.
