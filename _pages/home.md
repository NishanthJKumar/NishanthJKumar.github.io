Hi there, and welcome to my personal website! My name's Nishanth and I'm an AI + Robotics Research Scientist and Software Engineer who moonlights as an author and entrepreneur.

Presently, I'm a Junior at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/) who's *officially* concentrating in Computer Engineering and researching AI within the Computer Science department, but *unofficially* does everything from [novel writing](https://orgsync.com/126728/chapter) to [promoting undergrad research](https://cs.brown.edu/people/meta-ura/) within the CS department. In the past, I've helped develop and run Brown's [Graduate-Level Reinforcement Learning course](http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs2951f/), [launched high-altitude balloons](https://brownspace.org/rd/) with Brown Space Engineering and even served as a [Science Tour Guide](https://www.brown.edu/admission/undergraduate/visit/physical-sciences-tour). Outside of CS and Engineering, I run a [coaching and college-counseling company](https://www.paragon.school/) for high-school students and sometimes try to make progress on a young-adult sci-fi novel I've been writing for the last 6 years (that will hopefully be done *someday*...).

I grew up playing street-cricket and learning to love Dosa in [Coimbatore, India](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Coimbatore,+Tamil+Nadu,+India/@11.0116773,76.8268011,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x3ba859af2f971cb5:0x2fc1c81e183ed282!8m2!3d11.0168445!4d76.9558321). During my time in India, [I studied and eventually taught the IB](http://tipskovai.com/news-events/maths-geek-nishanth-kumar/), played a ton of [basketball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn2AA5p7Q-Y), wrote and semi self-published [a novel](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Book_of_the_Heavens.html?id=U_AKZPObpxsC), built and competed with [robots](https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/coimbatore-students-bag-award-in-robotics-contest/article7258141.ece), interned at a [startup accelerator](https://www.forgeforward.in/), and even built a [popular science fair project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvA7EftdSak).

If you're interested in reaching out or learning more about me, check out my social links in the website footer. If you'd like me to respond directly, I'm probably most available by email. I always love meeting new people and discussing, collaborating or advising in any way I can, so don't hesitate to contact!
