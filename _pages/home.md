Hi there, and welcome to my personal website! My name's Nishanth and I'm an AI + Robotics researcher and software engineer that doubles as an author and entrepreneur in my spare time.

Currently, I'm a Junior at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/) in Providence, USA; but I grew up eating dosa and playing street-cricket in [Coimbatore, India](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Coimbatore,+Tamil+Nadu,+India/@11.0116773,76.8268011,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x3ba859af2f971cb5:0x2fc1c81e183ed282!8m2!3d11.0168445!4d76.9558321).
