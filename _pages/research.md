Welcome to my Research page!
{: style="text-align: center;font-size: 120%;padding-top: 40px"}

I’m currently an Undergraduate Research Assistant in the [Humans 2 Robots](https://h2r.cs.brown.edu/) and [Intelligent Robot](http://irl.cs.brown.edu/) Labs at Brown University. I work within Brown’s [BigAI initiative](http://bigai.cs.brown.edu/) and am advised by Professors [Stefanie Tellex](https://cs.brown.edu/people/stellex/), [George Konidaris](http://cs.brown.edu/people/gdk/) and [Michael Littman](http://cs.brown.edu/~mlittman/).

## Research Interests
I’m broadly interested in the fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Robotics. More specifically, I’m drawn to the sub-fields of Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning, Classical AI Planning, Representation and Heuristics for Planning and Mixed Reality for Robotics. I’m particularly interested in working towards intelligent, collaborative robots; which lies at the intersection of all my different interests.

My current work involves thinking about good representations for AI agents and enabling efficient planning within them. Specifically, I’m focusing on object-oriented representations and how their inherent structure can be used to speed-up decision making under uncertainty. I believe that creating representations that are both highly-structured while also being intuitive to humans will enable more sample-efficient and explainable AI.

Other current things I’m interested in / working on include Active Learning, Learning from Demonstrations (LfD) and Transfer Learning, and using Mixed Reality to enable robots to effectively collaborate with and acquire multi-modal knowledge from humans.
