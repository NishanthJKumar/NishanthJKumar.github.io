Welcome to my Research page! I'm currently a Ph.D. student at the [LIS Group](https://lis.csail.mit.edu/) within [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/). I'm officially advised by [Leslie Kaelbling](https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/leslie-kaelbling) and [Tomas Lozano-Perez](https://people.csail.mit.edu/tlp/), though I frequently collaborate with [Dylan Hadfield-Menell](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4mVPFQ8AAAAJ&hl=en), [Josh Tenenbaum](http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/josh.html), and many other wonderful people within CSAIL's [Embodied Intelligence Initiative](https://ei.csail.mit.edu/). I'm extremely grateful for support from the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://engineering.brown.edu/news/2021-03-29/nsf-graduate-research-award).

## Research Areas
I'm broadly interested in enabling intelligent robots to solve a variety of tasks under the complex and dynamic conditions of the real world.
Thus far, I've worked towards this goal by pursuing a range of different topics including Imitation Learning, Planning and Abstraction, Active Learning,
Reinforcement Learning and Mixed Reality for Human-Robot collaboration.
