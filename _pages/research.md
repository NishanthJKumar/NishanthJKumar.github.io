Welcome to my Research page!
{: style="text-align: center;font-size: 120%;padding-top: 40px"}

I’m currently an Undergraduate Research Assistant in the [Humans 2 Robots](https://h2r.cs.brown.edu/) and [Intelligent Robot](http://irl.cs.brown.edu/) Labs at Brown University. I work within Brown’s [BigAI initiative](http://bigai.cs.brown.edu/) and am advised by Professors [Stefanie Tellex](https://cs.brown.edu/people/stellex/), [George Konidaris](http://cs.brown.edu/people/gdk/) and [Michael Littman](http://cs.brown.edu/~mlittman/).

In the past, I've had the opportunity to be a research intern at Uber ATG under [Prof. Raquel Urtasun](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~urtasun/) and collaborate with wonderful researchers at [MERL](https://www.merl.com/research/).

## Research Interests
I’m broadly interested in the fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Robotics. More specifically, I’m drawn to the sub-fields of Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning, Classical AI Planning, Representation and Heuristics for Planning and Mixed Reality for Robotics. I’m particularly interested in working towards both intelligent and collaborative robots: which lies at the intersection of all my different interests.
