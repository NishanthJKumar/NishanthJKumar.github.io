        <p>So this post is actually an article I wrote for my school‚Äôs student newsletter. I was asked to submit this some time before my TA internship at my school ended and I think it really encompasses my experience and views toward the IB. I‚Äôve put it here in the hopes that it might be useful to student coming into the IB or trying to decide on their IB school. I hope you guys have as fulfilling an experience as I did üôÇ</p>

<hr />

<p>‚ÄúIf the IB‚Äôs full of anything, it‚Äôs definitely numbers (especially if you take Math HL). There‚Äôs numbers everywhere: 3 HL‚Äôs and 3 SL‚Äôs, 120 hours of teaching, 4000 word EE, 1600 word TOK essay, 9 hours of class every-day, 15 papers of about 70 marks each; and of course, the final score out of 45.</p>

<p>The thing I‚Äôve noticed both during and after the IB is that people seem to only care about these numbers. How many words was your EE? How much did you get in TOK? What was your final number of CAS hours? And of course, the most common: What was your final score? These are the most frequently-asked questions I‚Äôve got. The last one is asked particularly often; so much so that I‚Äôve now become ‚Äúthe guy who got 45‚Äù to most people, as if I‚Äôm some disembodied walking number.</p>

<p>When I started the IB DP, I was obsessed with the numbers like all the aforementioned people. But looking back now, I realize IB wasn‚Äôt just a set of numbers to me. I think I speak for almost-all IB graduates when I say that: it‚Äôs about more than just numbers.</p>

<p>Yes, I got a 45: a perfect score. But that doesn‚Äôt even begin to quantify my IB experience.</p>

      A picture of everyone from my graduating IB Class

    </figcaption></figure>

<p>When I joined the IB, I was scared to stand-up and talk to a class of my peers. But now, I teach confidently in front of people I‚Äôve never met before. I‚Äôve even given a speech to the whole school. I‚Äôve made friends with previous strangers and attempted to understand their worldviews. 45 doesn‚Äôt quantify that humongous growth in my confidence.</p>

<p>When I began IB, I was so confused about who I was, who I wanted to be and what I wanted to do with my life. Now, I‚Äôve come to understand a few things: I‚Äôm driven, I‚Äôm a hopeless dreamer and I want to change the world as an Engineer. (I‚Äôm also a proud nerd!) That‚Äôs at least a start; but 45 doesn‚Äôt quantify that transformative self-discovery.</p>

<p>45 cannot represent the friends I‚Äôve made and all the amazing discussions I‚Äôve shared. It cannot begin to represent the projects I‚Äôve done, the successes I‚Äôve had and the failures I‚Äôve endured in this two-year roller-coaster.</p>

<p>45 does not fathom the heart-wrenching grief I felt when my dear Physics Teacher and EE Supervisor, Mr. Venkat, passed away of cancer. 45 says nothing of the promise I made to his memory, of the iron determination that gripped me to fulfill my promise and be Venkat Sir‚Äôs first student to achieve a perfect score.</p>

<p>45 doesn‚Äôt quantify what I felt when I got my results and cried with joy because I‚Äôd somehow fulfilled that impossible promise.</p>

<p>IB is about so much more than just numbers. It‚Äôs the first time most students (myself included) get a taste of freedom; freedom to pursue our own ideas and experiments and do whatever we fancy with time. And that can be scary, but it‚Äôs also exhilarating because we‚Äôre finally getting a taste of the real-world and all the responsibility that comes with it. To me, IB was about growing up, about understanding and learning more and becoming a better person. And I can honestly say that it was probably the best two years of my life.</p>

<p>Recently, I‚Äôve been asked by a lot of people ‚ÄúWhy do you still come to school?‚Äù. They seem so puzzled, so absolutely flabbergasted. I usually smile at that question, because I realize that everyone who asks it still doesn‚Äôt understand. They still think IB and school is all about numbers and that I‚Äôm done now because I got a 45.</p>

<p>But I don‚Äôt show up for numbers. I show up to learn more about the subjects and myself, to help others, to be in an environment I love with vibrant and amazing people and to interact with teachers who‚Äôve become like my family.</p>

<p>I show up for everything else; everything mere numbers can‚Äôt hope to measure.‚Äù</p>
