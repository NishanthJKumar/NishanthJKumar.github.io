Nishanth Kumar is a Ph.D. student in the LIS Group at MIT CSAIL, where his research is supported by an NSF GRFP fellowship. Nishanth's research interests lie in enabling robots to exhibit long-horizon, multi-task intelligent behavior in real-world scenarios. To this end, his work seeks to synthesize ideas from a number of sub-fields of AI, including Reinforcement Learning, Task and Motion Planning, Program Synthesis and Neurosymbolic AI. Previously, Nishanth obtained a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from Brown University, where he was a Goldwater Scholar, CRA Outstanding Undergrad Researcher Award Finalist, and was named the Outstanding Senior in Computer Engineering upon graduation.
