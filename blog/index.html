Since this was to be my first open-source library release, I spent a lot of time figuring out a good set of developer tools to speed up development and enable (hopefully) lots of people to use and contribute to the project in the future.

So, I thought I would describe PGMax’s setup in the hopes that it might help others interested in setting up their own open-source library.</p> </div> <hr> <div class="post-preview"> <h2><a href="/blog/2021/My-PhD-Statement-of-Purpose/">My PhD SoP</a></h2> <p class="post-meta">November 12, 2021</p> <p></p> <p>Writing a good PhD SoP can be a daunting task. Fortunately, there are plenty of good posts out there about how to approach the writing process and what a good SoP looks like (in particular, I followed the structure laid out by <a href="https://timdettmers.com/2018/11/26/phd-applications/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">this post</a> by <a href="https://timdettmers.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Tim Dettmers</a> and <a href="https://h2r.cs.brown.edu/writing-a-research-statement-for-graduate-school-and-fellowships/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">this post</a> by my undergrad advisor <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Pd8-ju0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Stefanie Tellex</a>). When I was writing my own SoP, what I probably found most-helpful on top of the above-linked posts was reading SoP’s by students in related areas who had been successful with the PhD application process (in particular <a href="https://blog.nelsonliu.me/2020/11/11/phd-personal-statement/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">this one</a> from <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~nfliu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Nelson Liu</a>). Given how much I benefitted from these, I figured I’d try to give back and contribute to the genre. Below, you can read the SoP that helped me get admitted to MIT:</p> </div> <hr> <div class="post-preview"> <h2><a href="/blog/2021/A-Beginner's-Guide-to-Undergrad-CS-Research/">A Beginner's Guide to Undergrad CS Research</a></h2> <p class="post-meta">August 18, 2021</p> <p></p> <p>Computer Science has become quite the popular field these days, <a href="https://cra.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Generation-CS.pdf" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">especially amongst undergraduates</a>. As a result, there are a <em>lot</em> more CS-related resources now than there ever were before. There are tons of books, lecture videos, guides, articles, and even memes about everything from understanding difficult CS concepts for coursework, to ‘cracking’ technical interviews, to applying to CS grad school. However, one aspect of an undergrad CS education that often gets left a bit in the dark is research [1]. While most University undergrads are probably aware that undergrad research opportunities exist, a surprising amount don’t <em>really</em> know (1) what undergrad research entails, (2) why they should care/potentially try to get involved, and (3) how to actually get a research opportunity. This is unfortunate because there’s been an overwhelming recent interest from students in going to CS graduate school or pursuing research-related jobs in industry, which both increasingly require at least <em>some</em> undergrad research experience.</p> </div> <hr> <div class="post-preview"> <h2><a href="/blog/2021/Strange-Python-List-Multiplication-Behavior/">Strange Python list multiplication behavior.</a></h2> <p class="post-meta">June 23, 2021</p> <p></p> <p>I recently spent on the order of 2 hours debugging some code that it only took me 1 hour to write.

Like most of my accomplishments, this one was only made possible by the support of friends and colleagues, and the mentorship of my incredible advisors at Brown. One resource I found particularly helpful for this application was previous successful applications, specifically <a href="https://vdean.github.io/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Victoria Dean’s</a> and <a href="https://blog.nelsonliu.me/2020/10/13/nsf-grfp-materials/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Nelson Liu’s</a>. Given how useful these were for me, I figured I’d share my own application materials to contribute to the genre and help any future applicants.

Admittedly, this used to be because I wanted nothing more than to become an MIT undergrad. However, I’ve continued to keep up with these blogs even after being rejected from MIT because many of the posts have been exceptionally genuine, relatable, and even insightful. In fact, I actually kept a copy of <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/50_things/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">one of my favorite advice posts</a> pinned to my phone’s notes app throughout my time in college and it stayed relevant and insightful over all 4 years.</p> </div> <hr> <div class="post-preview"> <h2><a href="/blog/2020/My-Goldwater-Application-Sample/">My goldwater application sample.</a></h2> <p class="post-meta">May 23, 2020</p> <p></p> <p>Earlier this year, I had the incredible privilege of being named a Goldwater Scholar. While winning the scholarship was rather validating and motivating, I thought the application process worthwhile in of itself because it forced me to think hard about my research direction and career goals for the future. During the application process, I found it incredibly helpful to read past sample applications. However, such samples are pretty few and far between, especially within the Computer Science or Mathematics categories.</p> </div> <hr> <div class="post-preview"> <h2><a href="/blog/2019/My-Main-Undergrad-College-Essay/">My main undergrad college essay.</a></h2> <p class="post-meta">October 04, 2019</p> <p></p> <p>I’ve been asked this a bunch of times and here it finally is: the essay I wrote for the CommonApp. I think it’s really representative of the headspace I was in at the time (and admittedly still am in, to some degree). If you’re reading this and struggling with college essay, then let me say that I’ve been there too and I’ve got advice: just write the most honest reflection of yourself. That’s it. And that’s what I attempted to do below.</p> </div> <hr> <div class="post-preview"> <h2><a href="/blog/2019/why-robots-deciding-what-I-want-to-do-with-my-life/">Why robots?

I was asked to submit this some time before my TA internship at my school ended and I think it really encompasses my experience and views toward the IB. I’ve put it here in the hopes that it might be useful to student coming into the IB or trying to decide on their IB school.
