Hi there, and welcome to my personal website! My name's Nishanth and I'm a researcher and engineer focused on AI, ML and robotics. I also moonlight as a writer.

Presently, I'm a Ph.D. student in the [LIS Group](https://lis.csail.mit.edu/) within [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/). I'm officially advised by [Leslie Kaelbling](https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/leslie-kaelbling) and [Tomás Lozano-Pérez](https://people.csail.mit.edu/tlp/) and work within the greater [Embodied Intelligence](https://ei.csail.mit.edu/) community of research at CSAIL. I'm extremely grateful for support from the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://engineering.brown.edu/news/2021-03-29/nsf-graduate-research-award). You can read more about my research [here](http://nishanthjkumar.com/research/).

Outside of research, I like to lift heavy things, [read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36308161-nishanth-kumar), play basketball, philosophize, cook, and sometimes make progress on various sci-fi novels/short-stories that I've been writing for longer than I care to admit.

If you're interested in learning more about me or reading some of my writing, check out my [resume](/misc_files/Nishanth_Resume.pdf), [blog](http://nishanthjkumar.com/blog/), [fiction writing](http://nishanthjkumar.com/fiction/), or social links in the website footer.
