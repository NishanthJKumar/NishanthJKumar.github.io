Hi there, and welcome to my personal website! My name's Nishanth and I'm a researcher and engineer focused on AI and ML applications to robotics. I also moonlight as a writer and entrepreneur.

Presently, I'm a Ph.D. student in the [LIS Group](https://lis.csail.mit.edu/) within [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/). I'm officially advised by [Leslie Kaelbling](https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/leslie-kaelbling) and [Tomás Lozano-Pérez](https://people.csail.mit.edu/tlp/), though I frequently collaborate with [Dylan Hadfield-Menell](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4mVPFQ8AAAAJ&hl=en) and many other wonderful people within CSAIL's [Embodied Intelligence Initiative](https://ei.csail.mit.edu/). I also spend time at the [Boston Dynamics AI Institute](https://theaiinstitute.com/) where I primarily work with [Jennifer Barry](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifer-barry-742a0799/). I'm extremely grateful for support from the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://engineering.brown.edu/news/2021-03-29/nsf-graduate-research-award).

In the recent past, I graduated from [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/) with honors in Computer Engineering. As an undergrad, I was fortunate to work on exciting [AI + Robotics research](https://nishanthjkumar.com/research/) under Brown’s [BigAI initiative](http://bigai.cs.brown.edu/) advised by Professors [Stefanie Tellex](https://cs.brown.edu/people/stellex/), [George Konidaris](http://cs.brown.edu/people/gdk/) and [Michael Littman](http://cs.brown.edu/~mlittman/). I spent time as a Research Intern at [Uber ATG](https://www.uber.com/ca/en/atg/research-and-development/) and [Vicarious AI](https://www.vicarious.com/), and even had the opportunity to collaborate with researchers at [MERL](https://www.merl.com/research/). 

Outside of all this, I like to play basketball, read, philosophize, cook, and sometimes make progress on various sci-fi novels/short-stories that I've been writing for longer than I care to admit.
