Hi there, and welcome to my personal website! My name's Nishanth and I'm a researcher and engineer focused on AI and ML applications to robotics. I also moonlight as a writer and entrepreneur.

Presently, I'm a Senior at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/) concentrating in Computer Engineering and [researching AI + Robotics](https://nishanthjkumar.com/research/) under Brownâ€™s [BigAI initiative](http://bigai.cs.brown.edu/) I'm advised by Professors [Stefanie Tellex](https://cs.brown.edu/people/stellex/), [George Konidaris](http://cs.brown.edu/people/gdk/) and [Michael Littman](http://cs.brown.edu/~mlittman/). In the past, I've been a Research Intern at [Uber ATG](https://www.uber.com/ca/en/atg/research-and-development/) under [Prof. Raquel Urtasun](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~urtasun/), collaborated with researchers at [MERL](https://www.merl.com/research/), helped develop and run Brown's [Graduate-Level Reinforcement Learning course](http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs2951f/), [launched high-altitude balloons](https://brownspace.org/rd/) with Brown Space Engineering, and even served as a [Brown Science Tour Guide](https://www.brown.edu/admission/undergraduate/visit/physical-sciences-tour). Outside of CS and Engineering, I run a [coaching and college-counseling company](https://www.paragon.school/) for high-school students and sometimes make progress on a young-adult sci-fi novel I've been writing for longer than I care to admit.

I grew up playing street-cricket and learning to love Dosa in [Coimbatore, India](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Coimbatore,+Tamil+Nadu,+India/@11.0116773,76.8268011,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x3ba859af2f971cb5:0x2fc1c81e183ed282!8m2!3d11.0168445!4d76.9558321). During my time in India, [I studied and eventually taught the IB](http://tipskovai.com/news-events/maths-geek-nishanth-kumar/), wrote and semi self-published [a novel](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Book_of_the_Heavens.html?id=U_AKZPObpxsC), built and competed with [robots](https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/coimbatore-students-bag-award-in-robotics-contest/article7258141.ece), and even built a [popular science fair project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvA7EftdSak).
